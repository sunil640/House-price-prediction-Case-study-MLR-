We had used the Linear Regression Model to identify the "Price" of the house.

We had used the common data, in which,
60% of the data is used for training the model with Linear Regression Model.
40% of the data remaining is used for testing the created & trained model.

Inorder to identify the accuracy of the model, following parameters has been identified:

regression co-efficient.
MAE
MSE
RMSE
R-Square (R2 score)
